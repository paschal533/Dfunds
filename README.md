# Conflux blockchain 🔗

Conflux is a high throughput first layer consensus blockchain that utilizes a unique Tree-Graph consensus algorithm, enabling the parallel processing of blocks and transactions for increased throughput and scalability.

## The CFX Token
Conflux’s token economy is built around the $CFX token, a unit of value on the platform that enables token holders to pay transaction fees, earn rewards through staking, rent storage, and participate in network governance. CFX also incentivizes and rewards miners, who ensure the secure operation of the Network.
